----------------------------------
Step 1: Create a Docker account
----------------------------------

What is Docker?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Docker** is a computer program that performs operating-system-level virtualization also known as containerization. it is developed by Docker,Inc.(https://www.docker.com/what-docker))

What is a Container?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A **Container Image** is a lightweight, stand alone executable package of a piece of software that includes everything needed to run it: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and settings. For more information click the link.(https://www.docker.com/what-container))

Step 2: Install python3 & pip3
------------------------------

To do the excerises in the Agave turtorial we are going to use a a python shell The default python shell is python 2.7.5 but we want to use python 3.6.5

To check to see if you have ``python3``  open your `Terminal`, once you have the terminal open type in the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   >>> python3


.. note:: This checks to see if you have python3 install. If  not please visit the python website(https://www.python.org).

Once you have the lastest python next you want to see if you have pip install. Similar to python the buildin version of pip is 2.7 but we want pip3 so you want to type in the follow:

.. code-block::bash

   >>> pip3

.. note:: If you dont have pip3 install use the following to install it:

   >>> sudo python3 get-pip.py
